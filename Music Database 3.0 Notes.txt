Welcome to another Iteration of my Music Database. 
This time around I'll be planning from the ground up.
Without further ado, let's start with the research

-----Overview-----
1. Create a Database of albums, artists, and sources and allow connectiosn between the 3.
     a. Albums: name, release date, catalog number, genre, classification, albumobtained, reference, album art, notes
     b. Artists: Name, reference, Activity, Database Activity, Obtained
     c. Sources: Name, Reference, Activity, Database Activity, Obtained
     d. Publishers: Name, Reference
     e. Join Tables: Album/Artist Composer, Arranger, Performer, Album/Source, Aliases, Units
2. Create a Website to view the database.
